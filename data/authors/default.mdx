Sober on the Spectrum was created by Todd Huyett in the summer of 2025 to fill a gap — a place for autistic and neurodivergent people to explore sobriety, recovery, and self-understanding together. Todd, who is autistic, founded the community after a serious alcohol-related car accident that injured another person. In the aftermath, he chose to take a more active role in sobriety and accountability. Sober on the Spectrum was established to provide a space to consolidate knowledge, learn from research, and connect with others who understand the sensory, social, and emotional realities that shape autistic experiences with alcohol and substance use.

### Community Guidelines

- Respect everyone. No hate speech, discrimination, or personal attacks.

- No medical advice. Share experiences, not prescriptions or treatment instructions.

- Protect privacy. Don’t share anyone’s story or identifying details without permission.

- Different paths are valid. Whether sober, curious, or working toward change — everyone is welcome.

- Keep it kind and constructive. Use content warnings for sensitive topics, and assume good intent.

- Safety first. Posts encouraging self-harm or substance use will be removed to protect the community.
